# pyCollisions2D

This is a tiny project I did, just because I wanted to fully understand elastic
collisions with different mass objects. I also like to see stuff colliding. I
wanted to finish it ASAP, so I did it using Python and PyGame. You'll need both
to execute it.


## Colliding stuff

The particles collide elastically (the kinetic energy before the collision is
the very same that after the collision) in a 2D world.

Particles have different masses: the darker a particle is, the heavier it is;
so black particles will be very hard to move, while white particles will bounce
around a lot.
